## Yoga Adi Pranata Web Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website designed to showcase my projects, skills, and professional background in a clean and organized layout. The site includes an interactive contact form that is directly connected to Google Sheets, allowing me to efficiently manage and track incoming messages without additional backend setup. This project demonstrates my ability to create functional, user-friendly interfaces and integrate external services to enhance user interaction.
